                <h2>How To play?</h2>
                <p>
                    You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what
                    most
                    people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't
                    quite
                    as simple as you think!
                </p>
                <h2>Rules for Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
                <p>
                    The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
                    You are X , your friend (or the computer in this case) is O . Players take turns putting their marks
                    in
                    empty squares.
                    The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
                    When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a
                    tie.
